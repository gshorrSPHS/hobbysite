<p>Citizens, take control. Take control of your city!</p>

<p>Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.</p>

<p>This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.</p>

<p>Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr Maroni... I recommend you buy American.</p>

<p>But it's not who you are underneath... it's what you do that defines you.</p>

<p>Behind you, stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison, where a thousand men have languished under the name of this man: Harvey Dent.</p>

<p>Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.</p>

<p>You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.</p>

<p>No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an idel and if they can't stop you then you become something else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne.</p>

<p>Very well. Death! By exile.</p>

<p>Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.</p>

<p>It will be extremely painful... for you</p>

<p>Swear to me!</p>

<p>You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.</p>
